## What we do

### We are GraphQL experts

[ icon: connectdevelop ]

Support multiple API clients with differing needs with flexibility and
performance that eclipses REST.  We can convert REST APIs to GraphQL, or you
can have both with a common code base.

### We ♥️ Elixir, Ruby & Javascript

[ icon: git ]

We support GraphQL API builds in all of the above languages. Whether your
company is a Rails, Phoenix or Node shop, we have you covered.

### We craft great web and mobile experiences

[ icon: mobile ]

We use the Apollo and Relay GraphQL clients on the web to take advantage of
sophisticated GraphQL features such streaming and subscriptions, query
optimisation and caching.

### We live in the ☁️

[ icon: cloud ]

Our clients are offered the option of Alembic taking care of deployment and
hosting.  We use a standardised AWS environment to offer seamless blue/green
deployments with continuous delivery, monitoring and alerting.

### We have a relentless focus on simplicity

[ icon: thumb-tick ]

We build software as lean and simple as possible. This makes it easier to
understand, reduces the surface area for defects, reduces the cost of
onboarding and training new developers and reduces the cost of change.

### We hold ourselves to high standards

[ icon: bullseye ]

We practice test-driven development and every commit is pushed though a
Buildkite CI pipeline. Quality and performance metrics are captured on every
build and we use Calibre to ensure fast and responsive apps and catch and fix
any regressions.
