# Alembic Website

This website is built with Gatsby. We store primary content as Markdown files on disk and use Github as a lightweight CMS.

Pushing to `master` will deploy to production using Netlify. Opening a PR will deploy a preview branch. Deployments are tracked in Slack `#website` channel.

Run locally with:

    yarn run gatsby develop
