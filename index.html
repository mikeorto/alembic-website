					<h2><i class="fa fa-connectdevelop"></i>We are <strong>GraphQL</strong> experts</h2>
					<p>
						Support multiple API clients with differing needs with flexibility and
						performance that eclipses REST.  We can convert REST APIs to GraphQL, or you
						can have both with a common code base.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h2><i class="fa fa-git"></i>We ♥️ Elixir, Ruby &amp; Javascript</h2>
					<p>
						We support GraphQL API builds in all of the above languages. Whether your
						company is a Rails, Phoenix or Node shop, we have you covered.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h2><i class="fa fa-mobile"></i>We craft great <strong>web</strong> and <strong>mobile</strong> experiences</h2>
					<p>
						We use the Apollo and Relay GraphQL clients on the web to take advantage of
						sophisticated GraphQL features such streaming and subscriptions, query
						optimisation and caching.

				<div class="item">
					<h2><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i>We live in the cloud</h2>
					<p>

				<div class="item">
					<h2><i class="fa fa-thumb-tack"></i>We have a <em>relentless</em> focus on <strong>simplicity</strong></h2>
					<p>
						We build software as lean and simple as possible. This makes it easier to
						understand, reduces the surface area for defects, reduces the cost of
						onboarding and training new developers and reduces the cost of change.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h2><i class="fa fa-bullseye"></i>We hold ourselves to high standards</h2>
					<p>
						We practice test-driven development and every commit is pushed though a
						Buildkite CI pipeline. Quality and performance metrics are captured on every
						build and we use Calibre to ensure fast and responsive apps and catch and fix
						any regressions.
