					<h1>About Alembic</h1>
					<p>
						Alembic delivers highly performant software across technology stacks and
						specialises in the design and build of GraphQL APIs and front ends to
						leverage the capabilities of GraphQL.
					</p>

					<p>
						We want to work with startups and enterprise customers who are making
						bold and brave technology choices. These companies have leaders and
						team members who aware of the power of GraphQL, or want to know more
						about how GraphQL can positively alter their technology landscape.
					</p>

					<p>
						Whether your teams develop in Elixir, Ruby or Javascript or a
						combination of all, we believe that GraphQL (GraphQL.org) makes a
						big difference for development teams that require flexibility, type
						safety and tooling support for API consumption.
					</p>

					<p>
						We will help you grow and change your technology stack, partnering
						with you to help you understand how to achieve the absolute best for
						your IT investment.

					<p>
						Support multiple API clients with differing needs with flexibility and
						performance that eclipses REST.  We can convert REST APIs to GraphQL, or you
						can have both with a common code base.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h2><i class="fa fa-tint"></i>We ♥️ Elixir, Ruby &amp; Javascript</h2>
					<p>
						We support GraphQL API builds in all of the above languages. Whether your
						company is a Rails, Phoenix or Node shop, we have you covered.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h2><i class="fa fa-mobile"></i>We craft great <strong>web</strong> and <strong>mobile</strong> experiences</h2>
					<p>
						We use the Apollo and Relay GraphQL clients on the web to take advantage of
						sophisticated GraphQL features such streaming and subscriptions, query
						optimisation and caching.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h2><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i>We live in the cloud</h2>
					<p>
						Our clients are offered the option of Alembic taking care of deployment and

				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h2><i class="fa fa-thumb-tack"></i>We have a <em>relentless</em> focus on <strong>simplicity</strong></h2>
					<p>
						We build software as lean and simple as possible. This makes it easier to
						understand, reduces the surface area for defects, reduces the cost of
						onboarding and training new developers and reduces the cost of change.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h2><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>We hold ourselves to high standards</h2>
					<p>
						We practice test-driven development and every commit is pushed though a
						Buildkite CI pipeline. Quality and performance metrics are captured on every
						build and we use Calibre to ensure fast and responsive apps and catch and fix
						any regressions.
