				<h1>Robustness. Scalability. Performance.</h1>
				<p>
					We are a software consultancy leveraging the inherent robustness
					and productivity of the Elixir/Phoenix/GraphQL stack.
				</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section id=about-us>
			<h1>About us</h1>

			<p>
				Alembic is an Australian-based technology consultancy that is passionate
				about delivering software that promotes speed to market and simplicity in
				the best languages possible. We are focussed on delivering
				<a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> and <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> projects.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id=what-we-do>
			<h1>What we do</h1>

			<p>
				We want to work with small to mid-sized startups as well as larger enterprise
				customers who are making bold and brave ‘newer’ technology choices like Elixir
				and GraphQL. These companies have members who aware of the power of functional
				programming languages and understand Ruby and Rails provides only so much
				return, and that the power of Elixir supports hyper-flexible businesses with
				very very fast time to production for their ever changing requirements and
				growing customer bases.
			</p>

			<p>
				We want our market to understand we are part of the startup community as
				well, and that we want to grow with them.
			</p>

			<p>
				We want to set the tone that Alembic will always be on the front foot when it
				comes to implementing the best technology has to offer.
			</p>

		<section id=philosophy>
			<h1>Our philosophy</h1>

			<p>
				Hey, really, we love Ruby. We've been delivering Ruby projects since
				the language first came onto the tech scene. However, we believe Ruby
				only takes you so far. From our experience we've seen that once a
				codebase gets big the efficiencies of using Ruby begin to diminish.
				Things start to slow down and codebases become increasingly difficult
				to maintain - especially with large-scale, distributed, highly
				available, high traffic systmes and applications.
			</p>

			<p>
				Functional programming is a great way to combat these issues. We can absolutely
				show you how you can begin to incorporate Elixir and GraphQL into your
				technology stack where is makes the most sense.
			</p>

		</section>

		<section id=process>
			<h1>Process</h1>	

			<p>
				We have been building software in many different languages and industries
				since the 80's, and we are seriously passionate about doing the simplest
				thing possible to get software into production.
			</p>

			<p>
				We have an active open source project that is an implementation of
				GraphQL written in Elixir http://graphql-elixir.org/
			</p>

			<p>
				If you want to build your own Elixir development team we can work
				alongside you, pairing with people who are learning. We prefer to enable
				technologists through delivering real projects, but we can also provide
				time-boxed proofs of concept that will help you determine how much Elixir
				you can handle.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can work directly with you and your teams to deliver projects, or we
				can deliver entire projects for you.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id=community>
			<h1>Community</h1>

			<p>
				We’re keen to grow the Elixir and GraphQL communities and enjoy enabling
				other people to develop in these technologies.
			</p>

			<p>
				Josh and James will co-host GraphQL Sydney and Josh co-hosts Elixir Sydney.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here's a presentation on recursion Josh gave at the last Elixir Sydney meet-up.
