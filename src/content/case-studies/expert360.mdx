## Expert 360 Case Study

### The Challenge

Company: Expert360 is an online marketplace co-founded by Bridget Loudon and Emily Yue and headquartered in Sydney, Australia.
The platform needed to scale as the startup was becoming international, and it needed enhanced security.

### The Solution

Alembic proposed a more robust technology stack built on Elixir and GraphQL that would improve the IT infrastructure to increase its ability to handle high levels of concurrency.

### The Outcome

Paired with their team to migrate existing infra to new platform
Retooled their dev community to move to the new tech stack
Engaged the community to help Expert360 grow
They now stand on their own two feet with their infra

### Why We Love this Client

We love all our clients that embrace modernizing tech stacks.
Also loved working with the client because of their commitment to gender equality / equal opportunity.
They opened their space to the Elixir community and we now host gatherings out of their office.

This is for testing
