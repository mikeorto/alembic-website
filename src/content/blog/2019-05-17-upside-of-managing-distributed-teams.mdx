title: "The Upside of Managing Distributed Teams"
author: "Suzie Price & Michael Ortolano"

A distributed team is a group of individuals who work across time,
space and organizational boundaries with links strengthened by webs of communication technology.

Distributed projects are a norm for many reasons; whether they be access to talent,
operating expense pressures or a desire to provide staff with more flexibility when and where they work.
These and other causes permeate corporations and startups alike, as most development projects cross time zones and cultures.
Though this may seem more difficult and complicated than managing teams locally,
at Alembic we have a positive understanding of how distributed teams force higher awareness of workplace culture.
What do we mean by this?

Everything that matters in managing local teams, matters even more in managing distributed teams.
Establishing personal connections with each and every remote team member is not only key,
it is fundamental in maintaining healthy team dynamics.
Routine individual check-in's and group stand-ups are required on a daily basis in order to ensure everyone is always on the same page.
Often, in an office environment where everyone is together, we lose sight of the fact that sharing the same space and being
on the same page do not necessarily go hand in hand.
With a distributed team, we never forget how much necessary work it is to maintain a healthy team dynamic.

In many ways, it is possible to think of distributed teams as a necessary evolutionary step
to accommodate globalization while improving workplace culture.
Though acclimating to this reality can take time, the benefit of managing remote teams is that one can ever
become too comfortable with the surroundings.
We've worked on many projects with remote team members, in the past and present, and continue to stand firm
by its positive impact on our company and our clients.

We're happy to lend our experience to companies just getting their feet wet in distributed team management,
or others hoping to improve the effectiveness of already established distributed teams.
We'd love to chat!
