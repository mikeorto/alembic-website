[YOW Lambda Jam](https://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au/) is one of the best Australian conferences for
software developers interested in functional programming.
This year it's in Melbourne running from 13th to 15th May.

Last year YOW added a series of introductory workshops which run the day before the main 2 day conference and called it the [Welcome to Functional Programming Day](https://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au/welcome-to-functional-programming-intro-day/).
This allows programmers who aren't as familiar with functional programming to get a gentle introduction to the basic concepts.

This year Alembic's Technical Directors (James and Josh) are honoured to be presenting an [Introduction to Elixir](https://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au/proposal/?id=9655).
We'll be starting at the beginning of Elixir and covering the basics of the [Elixir language](https://elixir-lang.org).
Elixir is a really simple language so we'll have the basics down by lunchtime.

Then once you're armed with the fundamentals we'll start building a real-time game server and client using the newly released [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view).
This amazing library allows real-time web applications to be built with no custom JavaScript in the browser.

Imagine doing all of your client processing on the server and Phoenix takes care of sending the DOM updates
to the browser over a websocket or HTTP/2 connection. This means that you can build amazing applications faster
and we can't wait to show it to you!
