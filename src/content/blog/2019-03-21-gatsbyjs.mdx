When I began my internship with Alembic 5 weeks ago I figured I would be playing ball within a known court. TypeScript? No problems, I know JavaScript it would just take a little adjusting of the brains. Elixir? I knew enough of Elixir to know that I would enjoy learning it. GraphQL? Piece of cake, makes more sense to me than REST.

But GatsbyJS?

What the hell was Gatsby? Outside of a fictional reference and a South African street food
I had never heard the term being used. Little did I know I would be spending the good part of my internship (and now my employment) delving into it's secrets. And I have to tell you, I fell in love with it really quickly.

<div style="width:300px; font-size:80%; text-align:center; float:right; margin: 10px; ">

GatsbyJS is a JavaScript framework geared towards the creation of static sites. Traditionally, static sites were html driven, and when you wanted to change the data contained on the site, you would have to change the html. Gatsby allows you to create a static site using React components. What does that mean? It means you get to programmatically generate content using all the power of React components, such as props and hooks. But even more than that, you can pull data into your components using GraphQL.

But even MORE than that - and this, for me, is the pièce de résistance - you can create content using Markdown or MDX, link it up to a default layout and node creator, and Gatsby will generate the pages for you using GraphQL calls.

<div style="width:150px; font-size:80%; text-align:center; float:left; margin:45px 20px 10px 10px">

This, what you are reading currently, is in an MDX file sitting somewhere snug in our filesystem and being delivered to you courtesy of GraphQL. No longer need we sift through the riff raff of HTML tags and badly indented code (you know who you are!), Gatsby allows us to smugly retain distance from the forest, and throw seeds of content into the thicket.

And it's fast. Blazingly fast. Page loading is instant. Just like what you would expect from a static site. And the Gatsby eco-system is modular, allowing you to easily add functionality via the use of plugins. And if you can't find the functionality you want...make a plugin for it. Gatsby allows you to do that.

It's powerful. And fun! Gatsby brings the joy back into website development. It's complex enough to be challenging but fluid enough (as long as you stick to the Gatsby conventions) to allow a certain flow in how you create your web site. It at times blurs the line between what it means for something to be front-end or back-end, but it does so in a way that makes sense eventually.
