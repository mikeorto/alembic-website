# We're hiring 

At Alembic we’re building a team of people who love learning and are
enthusiastic about the latest technologies whilst focussing on solving
real world problems for our clients. We choose technologies such as
Elixir, React and GraphQL because we understand they can solve
problems faster and more effectively for our clients, as well as
providing a more enjoyable, productive environment to build software.

We believe in building high quality, maintainable software with test
driven development, code reviews and refactoring baked into the way we
do things. For a consulting company you’ll be surprised at how remote
friendly we are. Whilst visiting the client site will be needed, we
are happy to have the hard conversations about you working remotely on
a regular basis. We have a strong reputation in the industry and our
work mostly comes from referrals with clients ranging from startups to
large corporates looking to innovate.

## Who are we looking for?

### Developers

We are looking for Developers of all levels to work with us, ideally
on a permanent basis. Experience with Elixir, React and GraphQL would
be great, as this is predominantly our tech stack, although experience
in other languages and a love for functional programming and test
driven development would also be interesting to us.

### Lead Technical Consultant

As well as seeking developers to work on our project work, we are also
looking for Lead Technical Consultants who will be able to work
closely with our clients and be the principal contact for our client
and be the main point of contact when they have any queries on
delivery, as well as supporting the developers in the team and
mentoring them as needed.

As well as having similar tech skills to those we’ve mentioned above
we would want you to display the following skills:

- Demonstrating the ability to lead a team of Alembic developers
- Solid technical/product delivery capability
- Ability to mentor other developers
- Feel comfortable starting a project in the “discovery” stage and
  assisting clients with driving requirements
- Strong independence as well as the ability to work collaboratively
  on projects with the team.

Our consultants enjoy working together collaboratively on a variety of
different technical challenges within a wide range of different
business domains, whilst working on a tech stack they really enjoy.

## Technologies

We're currently working with clients to deliver products/applications
in the following technologies/methodologies and would love your help:
Elixir, GraphQL, React, React Native, NodeJS, TypeScript, Functional
programming, TDD, Continuous Delivery, DevOps, AWS, Azure, GCP,
Kubernetes.
