## GraphQL for the Modern Web

Consume data exposed by your backend with efficiency, simplicity and
flexibility that eclipses REST.

With built-in, real-time subscriptions, this is the future of web
applications and the APIs that feed them their data.

Unify arbitrary or legacy APIs behind a single GraphQL endpoint,
making your client applications easy to write and the developers
who write them unbelievably productive.
