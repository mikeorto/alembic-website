# We're Alembic, and this is our <a href="http://slashpurpose.org">purpose</a>

We want to build software that empowers our clients and enriches the
lives of their customers. We want to relentlessly improve ourselves,
which in turn, helps us improve the services we offer to our clients
and their customers.

## Learning and Enjoyment

We want to ensure all people of Alembic thrive both professionally and
personally. This includes a clear distinction between work time and
personal time. We want to look forward to coming to work, while also
enjoying rest and relaxation with our families.

While at work, we should love the work we're doing. We need our work
to be meaningful and to make a difference in the world around us.

## Inclusivity

We want to foster an environment of inclusion and equality. We believe
that all humans are fundamentally equal, but bring different, and
incredible qualities to the table.

## Quality

We want the software we build and design to be of very high quality.
We define quality in terms of:

  * Simplicity
  * Human centred
  * Minimalism
  * Integrity
  * Correctness
  * Scalability
  * Ease of change
  * Accessibility
  * Understandable
  * Friendliness

Furthermore, we strive to continuously improve software development
for our clients. We want them to be as happy to be working with us as
we are happy to be building software for them.

## Trust

We want our colleagues to share our relentless desire to improve, our
unquenchable curiosity, our insatiable desire for finding a better
way. We should be open, supportive and an asset to those we work with.
We should be each others' cheer squad.

## Longevity

We want to form long-term, fruitful relationships. Success is a
marathon, not a sprint. We strive to never betray our core values for
short-term profit. We also want to choose the tools that last the test
of time.
