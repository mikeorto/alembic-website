Elixir Camp is a place for people interested in Elixir, Erlang and related technologies to gather, network, share ideas and generally have a great time.

The camp is run by the community once (maybe twice a year).

## Diversity and Inclusion

While there's a general focus on Elixir developers, people of any background are encouraged to attend. We are committed to creating an open and inclusive community and as such have started developing a series of policies and initiatives that you can read more about [here](https://elixir.camp/DiversityAndInclusion).

## You should come to Elixir Camp if:

- You like Elixir/Erlang
- You want to learn Elixir from experts
- You're into building high speed, fault tolerant, distributed applications
- You've got specialist knowledge and you'd like to share with other enthusiasts
- You're interested in web technologies
- You've got a weekend project you really want to work on
