GraphQL is a new way to build fast and flexible APIs (not necessarily just for
the web either). Come along and see what all the fuss is about!

</a>
We meet the 1st Wednesday of each month to talk about Elixir and
Erlang and associated technologies. Most months we have talks but we
sometimes host practical coding nights. Beginners are always welcome
to join and we try to keep talks accessible to those new to the
language and ecosystem.

  <h3>Elixir Camp</h3>
</a>
Elixir Camp is a place for people interested in Elixir, Erlang and
related technologies to gather, network, share ideas and generally
have a great time.

Our aim is to make technology more approachable by creating a fun
and friendly environment for people to come together and learn about
Elixir, Phoenix and Functional Programming.
