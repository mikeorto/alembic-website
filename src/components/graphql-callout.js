        <p>
          Consume data exposed by your backend with efficiency, simplicity and
          flexibility that eclipses REST.
        </p>

        <p>
          With built-in, real-time subscriptions, this is the future of web
          API's.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unify arbitrary or legacy API's behind a single GraphQL endpoint,
          making your clients easy to write and the developers whom write them
          very happy.
