        <p>
          Consume data exposed by your backend with efficiency, simplicity and
          flexibility that eclipses REST.
        </p>

        <p>
          With built-in, real-time subscriptions, this is the future of web
          applications and the APIs that feed them their data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unify arbitrary or legacy APIs behind a single GraphQL endpoint,
          making your client applications easy to write and the developers
          who write them unbelievably productive.
        </p>
