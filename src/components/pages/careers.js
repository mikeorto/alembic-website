        <h1>We're hiring</h1>
        <p>
          At Alembic we’re building a team of people who love learning and are
          enthusiastic about the latest technologies whilst focussing on solving
          real world problems for our clients. We choose technologies such as
          Elixir, React and GraphQL because we understand they can solve
          problems faster and more effectively for our clients, as well as
          providing a more enjoyable, productive environment to build software.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in building high quality, maintainable software with test
          driven development, code reviews and refactoring baked into the way we
          do things. For a consulting company you’ll be surprised at how remote
          friendly we are. Whilst visiting the client site will be needed, we
          are happy to have the hard conversations about you working remotely on
          a regular basis. We have a strong reputation in the industry and our
          work mostly comes from referrals with clients ranging from startups to
          large corporates looking to innovate.
        </p>
        <h2>Who are we looking for</h2>
        <h3>Developers</h3>
        <p>
          We are looking for Developers of all levels to work with us, ideally
          on a permanent basis. Experience with Elixir, React and GraphQL would
          be great, as this is predominantly our tech stack, although experience
          in other languages and a love for functional programming and test
          driven development would also be interesting to us.
        </p>
        <h3>Lead Technical Consultant</h3>
        <p>
          As well as seeking developers to work on our project work, we are also
          looking for Lead Technical Consultants who will be able to work
          closely with our clients and be the principal contact for our client
          and be the main point of contact when they have any queries on
          delivery, as well as supporting the developers in the team and
          mentoring them as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          As well as having similar tech skills to those we’ve mentioned above
          we would want you to display the following skills:

            assisting clients with driving requirements
          </li>
          <li>
            Strong independence as well as the ability to work collaboratively
            on projects with the team.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our consultants enjoy working together collaboratively on a variety of
          different technical challenges within a wide range of different
